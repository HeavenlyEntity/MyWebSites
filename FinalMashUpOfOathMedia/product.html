               <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center">Hello I'm <strong>Alec</strong>, I am <strong>21 years old</strong>. When I was little I began the trend of taking things apart, all my toys to my RC cars I used to race, to the tv remotes. When I was 13 I began the journey of building computers, my first complete build was in a "emachines" using parts I gather from my local PC part shop and "<strong><em>Goodwill</em></strong>".  Later on, I stuck my head into programming when I was introduced to <strong>Minecraft</strong> by a friend of mine. When I was 15, I had taken computer tech class in middle school that only certain kids were qualified to take touching in on the basics of <em><strong>HTML</strong></em>, <em><strong>CSS</strong></em>, and <em><strong>JS</strong></em> along with <strong><em>computer hardware</em></strong> functionality. My first successful website I built was a like a "<em><strong>Facebook</strong></em>" profile but just featuring a picture, bio, and "what I wanted to do when I grew up and why". It was hard, very hard. Yet I stepped through it and did my research to conquer that project. My teacher was very pleased, she adored my creativity and use of styling. I realized what I wanted to be when I graduated high school in 2015, with a 2.98 GPA. By this time I had experience with multiple coding languages, networking, graphic design, photography, poetry, and audio recording. My mind set me on the road for college as I headed to <strong><em>Glendale Community College</em></strong> as my first step. I had enrolled and attended for 2 years getting <strong>all my prerequisites</strong> done and finished for my Associates in Science and/or Computer Science, until I got a call from "<strong><em>WOZ-U</em></strong>" and was offered a spot in their "<strong>Software Development</strong>" program. I qualified for every program they had available, but I chose the Development path with a "success grant" I also qualified for I jumped right in. Before all this happened, it wasn't my desire to be a "<em>Software</em> <em>Developer</em>" I wanted to be a "<em>Computer Hardware Engineer</em>" but as time goes by I thought to myself and looked at it through a business perspective and knew "Developers are the key to marketing as to operating.". Now here I am, a dream currently conquering, a future patiently achieving.
                 Thank you for taking the time to read my story,  maybe you can pass it on to anyone else you think would admire such a story. Thank you! </p>
